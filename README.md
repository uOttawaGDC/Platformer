# Platformer

uOttawa game dev club project. Live demo hosted [here](https://uottawagdc.github.io/Platformer/PlatformerDemo).

# Development

1 Clone this git repo to your desktop. 

2 Start unity

3 Open the "PlatformerBuild" folder in unity to run the working build of the game

# Building levels

Drag the different square shaped prefabs into the scene. Different tiles like water and vines will give the player different properties when the player is over top of them. Tiles should not be resized. To make a large area of one tile type simply use multiple tiles.
